            <h2 class="blog-post-title">What do you think DevOps is?</h2>
              <p>The simple question that almost no one gets right at interviews.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>I've done my share of technical interviews for ops positions over the last year and one question almost no candidate gets right is:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <strong><em>What do you think DevOps is?</em></strong>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I mean, don't get me wrong, I am not one of those guys who expects you to answer with the exact same words I'd use to answer that myself. But, let's face it, <em>DevOps</em> definitions are <a href="https://www.google.pt/search?q=what+is+devops" target="_blank">everywhere</a> on the internet and if you're applying for a job in a web company you should at least have a grasp of what it is.</p>
            <p>I might fail to express where my frustration is coming from but I've heard things like:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <em>DevOps is using chef or puppet.</em>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <em>DevOps are those guys who do everything.</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>And read things like:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <em>DevOps is devs deploying without ops.</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Obviously I still try and see what strengths the candidate has to offer, but one of those simple <strong>lame</strong> answers will always stick in the back of my mind when I'm looking back at the interview.</p>
            <p>If I got asked that question during an interview, my answer would simply be:
              <blockquote>
                <em>DevOps is the culture of collaboration and agility between dev and ops.</em>
              </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>My definition is as good as any but it focus on the single thing that everyone tend to agree when it comes to <em>DevOps</em>: <strong>collaboration</strong> is essential to achieve amazing things in the web.</p>
            <p>There are a <em>gazillion</em> of other definitions and blog posts out there who touch this topic, one of the greatest is <em>Stephen Nelson-Smith</em>'s <a href="http://www.jedi.be/blog/2010/02/12/what-is-this-devops-thing-anyway/" target="_blank">What Is This Devops Thing, Anyway?</a> guest post on <em>Patrick Debois</em>'s <a href="http://www.jedi.be/blog/" target="_blank">Just Enough Developed Infrastructure</a> blog.
            <p>In the end, I want to hang all day next to people who share my culture and mentality when it comes to <strong>getting things done</strong> and there's nothing worse then the old <em>that's not my job</em> fictional boundary that lack of collaboration enables.</p>
            <p>Also it helps you not to shoot yourself in the foot, which is nice.</p>
