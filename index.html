              <h2 class="blog-post-title">Throw your personal agenda in the can.</h2>
              <p>No, really, do it.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>I’ve been working in both large strict enterprises and smaller startup places in the past few years. There are huge differences between those two types of environments but one thing on both of them that I came to realize, is that there is always this one guy (or team) that has a hidden personal agenda to achieve their own goals instead of the business ones.</p>
              <p>I wonder why this happens....</p>
              <p>I’ve done some thinking on the subject and I’ve managed to sum it up in some reasons that I think are the root cause of this behaviour on people:</p>
              <hr>
              <ul>
                <li>Lack of confidence</li>
                  <hr>
                  <p>This is probably the easiest conclusion to reach. If you don’t have confidence in your work and the value you bring to the business then you’ll be constantly trying to make yourself look good, even if you’re not really helping to achieve anything.</p>
                  <hr>
                <li>Fear of failing</li>
                  <hr>
                  <p>Specially in large enterprise environments there is this fear of failing and of suffering backlashes from it. I’m not saying that this is true on every place but truth is, once you have an extremely vertical structure, which is traditional on large enterprises, you start to have much smaller groups of trust and that, by it’s own, slowly destroys confidence between people who normally don’t work together everyday. 
                Also, it’s, in my opinion, one of the reasons operational silos tend to exist completely apart from each others.</p>
                  <hr>
                <li>Unhealthy competition</li>
                  <hr>
                  <p>Also a typical situation of large enterprise environments, but also strangely present in smaller ones, is the fact they people tend to compete, be it for recognition, rewards, or simply to be the highest paid position.</p>
                  <p>Humans are competitive by nature, I realize that, but in my opinion you can’t let that simple treat of nature define how you work and specially how you work with others.</p>
                  <hr>
                <li>False sense of pride</li>
                  <hr>
                  <p>I’ve seen people focus their energy in defending and elaborating a project/technology/solution just because of their pride or sense of ownership. Defending something you believe is more then fair but that doesn’t should cloud your judgment when it comes to listening and respecting other opinions and vision.</p>
              </ul>
              <hr>
              <p>Despite of all reasons, one thing I struggle, and probably always will struggle to figure out is, what urges that one guy to harm the work of others inside the same company? Is it a natural response to feeling threatened? Is it a way to try and get noticed? Is it just pure stupidity?</p>
              <p>I can’t honestly answer those questions, but there's one thing I know for certain, those are the kind of people you don’t want to work with or even want in your company at all. They have no ‘get things done’ mentality whatsoever and they normally do more harm then good.</p>
              <p>I’m still trying to find a good way to deal with this kind of situation, for now I’m trying to ignore them and remove pretty much all dependencies that would in the future force me to interact with them. Hopefully this will avoid me some headaches and will greatly reduce the chance of me having to swing a bat at someone who manages to piss me off for real.</p>
              <p>Stupidity is not a disease, so and in a nutshell, if you do have a personal agenda, go ahead and throw it in the can. Start getting things done, you’ll be so much happier and people will, naturally, start to appreciate you and the work you do more.</p>
