            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Zero lines of code</h2>
              <p>Those hectic days where you don't get to write a single line of code...</p>
            <hr>
            <p>As mainly an ops guy, and even if nowadays (thankfully!) that doesn't mean that you don't write code on your day to day job, I've had my share of days in which you're so strangled in troubleshooting production issues, doing capacity tests, or just trapped in meetings, that you realize that your work day is over and you haven't written a single line of code.</p>
            <p>While I was on the subway shuffling some <em>Led Zep</em> (the greatest rock band of all times, and I don't care what you say or think about that!), I was thinking of the day I just had and realized it had been one of those days. I then started to think how bad is this pattern? Even if the stuff you have done all day was <strong>REALLY, REALLY, REALLY</strong> important, what leads to a day like this and how bad is it for you?</p>
            <p>I've read something a while back on how the <a href="http://www.site-reliability-engineering.info/2014/04/what-is-site-reliability-engineering.html" target="_blank"><em>Google</em> SRE's defined the time an ops engineer should spend his time</a>. In a nutshell if you spend more then half of your time doing traditional ops stuff and not writing code for a project then you're not doing as well as you should, or the project you're on is likely not particularly good for you.</p>
            <p>That actually makes a hell of a lot of sense in my head. I mean, of course in a ops role you won't be coding all the time, you'll eventually still have to troubleshoot <em>CRC</em> port issues, unholy <em>GC</em> patterns or analyze <em>TSDB</em> graph spikes that seem to have no rational reasoning in this reality. But if you let yourself get trapped in a non-coding routine you'll eventually loose more then you'll win.</p>
            <p>Just think of the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Coding takes practice - just like riding a bike you won't forget how to code, but you'll loose muscle memory, pattern recognition, general ninjaness, and more.</li>
              <li>Languages evolve - although the <em>Perl</em> scripts you wrote 10 years ago (oh yeah, Perl baby!) might still work, by now you wouldn't know of things like <em>PSGI</em>, <em>Dancer</em>, etc.</li>
              <li>Developers speak strange things - how can you really discuss your application with full time developers if they talk about things that you know nothing of?</li>
              <li>Plain old simple fun - come on, seriously don't tell me you don't enjoy yourself when building or automating something out of nothing?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of this rant to say that I'm definitely going to work on not getting myself trapped in this kind of days often, and in my humble opinion everyone should do the same.</p>
